Hi, Iâ€™m Kenneth P,
I'm a highschool student intreseted in technology and making my own solutions to problems.
I'm always happy to learn new things so any help is welcome.
I hope to be able to colaberate on music, outdoors, and automotive related projects
as well as so much more as anything that grabs my attention is cool.
